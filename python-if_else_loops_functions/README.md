## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- The importance of indentation in Python
- How to use `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to assign values to variables
- How to use `while` and `for` loops
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- The purpose and use of the `pass` statement
- How to use `range`
- Functions: definition, usage, and return values
- Variable scope
- What a traceback is
- Arithmetic operators and their usage

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All files should end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

## Project Structure
(You may want to add details about the expected project structure or specific files required)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8.* installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
3. Start working on the tasks, focusing on one concept at a time
4. Use pycodestyle to check your code style

## Submission
(Add any specific instructions for project submission)

Good luck with your Python control structures and functions project!
