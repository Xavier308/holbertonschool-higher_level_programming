# Python Server-Side Rendering Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing server-side rendering (SSR) using Python and Flask. You'll learn to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications by generating web pages on the server and sending fully formed HTML to the client.

## Implementation

* **Xavier J. Cruz** - *Project implementation*

## Concept
- Python programming

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Understand server-side rendering and its differences from client-side rendering
2. Recognize the benefits of using SSR in web development
3. Implement SSR using Python and the Flask framework
4. Use the Jinja templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages
5. Read and display data from various sources (JSON, CSV, SQLite databases)
6. Handle dynamic content and user inputs in web applications

## What to Expect
You will build a Flask application that serves web pages using SSR techniques. The project will progress from creating basic templates to integrating dynamic content from multiple data sources.
