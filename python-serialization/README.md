# Python - Serialization

## Implemented by
Xavier J. Cruz (based on content by Javier Valenzani)

## Learning Objectives
- Articulate the differences and similarities between marshaling and serialization.
- Implement serialization in a practical programming task.
- Understand how serialized data can be used in web applications, databases, and network communications.
- Evaluate the performance implications of different serialization formats, like JSON, XML, and binary formats.

## Exercises

### 0. Basic Serialization
Create a module for serializing a Python dictionary to a JSON file and deserializing it back to a dictionary.

### 1. Pickling Custom Classes
Learn to use the `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects.

### 2. Converting CSV Data to JSON Format
Convert data from CSV format to JSON format using Python's `csv` and `json` libraries.

### 3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML
Explore XML serialization and deserialization using Python's `xml.etree.ElementTree` module.
