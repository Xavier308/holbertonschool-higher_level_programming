## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to ensure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the `with` statement
- What is JSON
- What is serialization and deserialization
- How to convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa
- How to access command line parameters in a Python script

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a newline
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files should end with a newline
- All test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- Tests should be executed using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
- Working collaboratively on test cases is encouraged


## Testing
Run the following command to execute all tests:
```
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```
