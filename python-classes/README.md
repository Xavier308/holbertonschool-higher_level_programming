# Python - Classes and Objects

## Implemented by
Xavier J. Cruz (based on content by Guillaume)


## Background Context

Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is essential for effective Python programming. This project is designed to give you practical experience with OOP concepts. Experimentation and practice are key, so type, test, and understand each example thoroughly.

### Resources

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
- [Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE&)
- Additional OOP resources in Python [Python Classes and Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html), [Object Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

### Learning Objectives

- What is OOP and "first-class everything"
- The definition and use of classes, objects, and instances
- The difference between a class and an instance
- The concepts of attributes and methods, and the use of `self`
- The implementation and purpose of the `__init__` method
- The principles of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- How to implement and use properties instead of public attributes
- The Pythonic way of writing getters and setters
- The functionality of the `__dict__` in classes and instances
- How Python handles attribute binding and retrieval
- The use of the `getattr` function

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Documentation is mandatory for each module, class, and method
- The code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Project Tasks

### 0. My First Square

An empty class `Square` that defines a square.

### 1. Square with size

Class `Square` defines a square by size, without type/value verification.

### 2. Size validation

Adds type and value validation to the size attribute of the `Square` class.

### 3. Area of a Square

Introduces an instance method to compute the area of the square.

### 4. Access and update private attribute

Implementing property and property setter for private instance attribute size.

### 5. Printing a square

A method `my_print` that prints the square using the `#` character.

### 6. Coordinates of a square

Extends the `Square` class to include a `position` attribute with getter and setter.
