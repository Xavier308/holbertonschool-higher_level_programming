# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project focuses on the practical application of Python data structures like sets and dictionaries. It's designed to enhance understanding of these structures, demonstrating their usage and advantages in various scenarios.

## Implemented by

- Iterate over dictionaries effectively.
- Define and use lambda functions.
- Understand and apply map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Requirements

- **Environment:** All scripts should run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Style:** All code must adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` file must be included at the root of the project folder.
