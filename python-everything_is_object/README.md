# Python - Everything is object

## Background Context

This project explores Python's object model and how it handles different types of objects. It aims to deepen understanding of Python's behavior with various object types, particularly focusing on mutability, identity, and reference concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is an object
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (memory address in CPython)
- Mutable and immutable types
- Built-in mutable types
- Built-in immutable types
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable

### .txt Answer Files
- Only one line
- No Shebang
- All files should end with a newline

## Tasks

The project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on different aspects of Python objects. These include:

0. Identifying object types
1. Getting variable identifiers
2-5. Comparing object references
6-9. String comparisons and identity
10-13. List comparisons and identity
14-15. List operations
16-18. Function parameter behavior
19. Copying lists
20-26. Tuple behavior
27-28. Object identity after operations

## Resources

- 9.10. Objects and values
- 9.11. Aliasing
- Immutable vs mutable types
- Mutation (Only this chapter)
- 9.12. Cloning lists
- Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing
