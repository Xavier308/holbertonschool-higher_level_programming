## Author

* **Guillaume** - *Project creator*

## Implementation

* **Xavier J. Cruz** - *Project implementation*

## Resources
- [3.1.3. Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
- [Data structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) (until 5.3. Tuples and Sequences included)
- [Learn to Program 6 : Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1HUzrvS-Pw)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What are lists and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Common methods of lists and how to use them
- Using lists as stacks and queues
- List comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- Tuple packing
- Sequence unpacking
- The `del` statement and how to use it

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
0. Print a list of integers
1. Secure access to an element in a list
2. Replace element
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
4. Replace in a copy
5. Can you C me now?
6. Lists of lists = Matrix
7. Tuples addition
8. More returns!
9. Find the max
10. Only by 2
11. Delete at
12. Switch
